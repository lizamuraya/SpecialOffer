🗂️ **The project tasks were divided into 3 parts, each accessible by changing the rootViewController in the SceneDelegate:**

– GiftTimerVC: This view controller is responsible for managing the countdown timer and animated gift icon.

– BannerVC: This view controller handles the banner information displayed at the top of the screen.

– MainVC: This view controller serves as the primary interface for the application, featuring the main functionality and user interaction elements.

By changing the root view controller in the SceneDelegate to **MainVC()**, **GiftTimerVC()**, or **BannerVC()**, you can access each part of the project independently.
